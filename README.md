## About me
I'm a Finance student passionate about financial modeling, valuation, and using data to solve real-world business problems. I enjoy learning quantitative methods, applying programming to finance workflows, and building projects that demonstrate analytical thinking.

## What I do
- Build financial models, forecasts, and valuation analyses
- Analyze datasets to extract actionable insights (equities, portfolios, or corporate finance)
- Automate repetitive workflows with Python, Excel, and SQL
- Learn and apply techniques from econometrics, time-series analysis, and risk management
- Share findings through reports, visualizations, and reproducible notebooks

## Key skills (example)
- Financial modeling & valuation (DCF, comparable analysis)
- Tools: Excel (advanced), Google Sheets
- Programming: Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib/plotly, scikit-learn
- Data: Bloomberg/Refinitiv basics, Yahoo Finance, web-scraping
- Practices: backtesting, portfolio analytics, scenario analysis

## Featured projects
